# Machine-Learning-Template
I have made a template for all those who gets stuck what to apply and where to apply. From Preprocessing Steps to varifying the model's accuracy, Everything has been covered which a new Machine Learning enthusiast would prefer. I have used Melbourne Dataset for determining house prices for given specifications. I have used three Classification Algorithm and Compared them to show which one can be efficient - Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost Regressor. I hope anyone who wants to get started with any kind of Machine Learning Competition on Kaggle can use this as template.
